Sorry for the code, it's very trashy...
I've done it to try understand how the board game works.

My intentions are only research, but it's fully playable, and all 48 criteria cards are implemented.

I'm not a web developper, so sorry for the code, in futur i'll probably refactor it with object oriented, or maybe not...

If you want to help me (refactor, explanations, support me for graphics or port for full web app or phone/tablet app), mail me at <lamarche_mathieu@yahoo.fr>
